# Requirements and Specification Document

## Full House of Badgers

### Project Abstract

The card game engine is a piece of software designed to cater to the players, offering a wide variety of card games. Players are welcomed into a dynamic virtual arena where they can engage in thrilling matches against friends or challengers from around the globe. The users will interact with a React frontend that communicates with our java backend card engine. The engine will connect to a MySQL database pod to store user logins as well as user scores and leaderboards.

### Customer

The customer for this software in general is anyone who wants to play card games like euchre socially.


### Tech Stack

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Java
* Database: MySQL

<!--A brief description of the customer for this software, both in general (the population who might eventually use such a system) and specifically for this document (the customer(s) who informed this document). Every project will have a customer from the CS506 instructional staff. Requirements should not be derived simply from discussion among team members. Ideally your customer should not only talk to you about requirements but also be excited later in the semester to use the system.-->

### User Requirements

<!--This section lists the behavior that the users see. This information needs to be presented in a logical, organized fashion. It is most helpful if this section is organized in outline form: a bullet list of major topics (e.g., one for each kind of user, or each major piece of system functionality) each with some number of subtopics.-->

| ID   | Description                                                  | Priority | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| #12  | Users should not have to sign into the client. | Med      | Open   |
| &1  | Users should be able to setup a game of euchre and play | High     | Open   |
| &5  | A user looking to delete their account should be able to do so | Med     | Open   |
| &4  | A user looking to see their lifetime statistics should be able to download them | Med      | Open   |
| &7  | A user looking to play a game with just their friends should be able to setup a private lobby | Low     | Open   |


### Use Cases & User Stories

<!--Use cases and user stories that support the user requirements in the previous section. The use cases should be based off user stories. Every major scenario should be represented by a use case, and every use case should say something not already illustrated by the other use cases. Diagrams (such as sequence charts) are encouraged. Ask the customer what are the most important use cases to implement by the deadline. You can have a total ordering, or mark use cases with “must have,” “useful,” or “optional.” For each use case you may list one or more concrete acceptance tests (concrete scenarios that the customer will try to see if the use case is implemented).-->

Our main user stories are as follows:
* As a player I want to be able to play Euchre
* As a player I want to be able to access and download my lifetime stats
* As a player I want to be able to change my name, delete my stats, and delete my account

With sub-stories currently being:
* As a player I want to interact with the cards
* As a player I want to be able to have an account
* As a player I want to have my statistics tracked
* As a player I want to be able to create a private lobby

![Use cases](use-cases.png)

As for acceptance critera, they are as follows:
* A user must be able to log on or make an account (in all use cases)
* A user must be able to create or find a game of euchre and play it to completion
* A user must be able to access their statistics and be able to download a file of their lifetime statistics
* A user must be able to edit characteristics of their account such as their name and but able to delete their stored statistics and/or their account entirely

### User Interface Requirements

<!--Describes any customer user interface requirements including graphical user interface requirements as well as data exchange format requirements. This also should include necessary reporting and other forms of human readable input and output. This should focus on how the feature or product and user interact to create the desired workflow. Describing your intended interface as “easy” or “intuitive” will get you nowhere unless it is accompanied by details.-->

<!--NOTE: Please include illustrations or screenshots of what your user interface would look like -- even if they’re rough -- and interleave it with your description.-->

![Low-fidelity prototype](../frontend/interface-prototypes/Low-Fidelity-Prototype.jpg)
[High-fidelity prototype link](../frontend/interface-prototypes/high-fidelity.pdf)

The high-fidelity interface is centered around a smaller, simpler box at first (see: "Menu", "Profile", and "Settings" panels for reference) that then expands into a full board upon entering a game. The small box from before then becomes the center of the board and a space for in-game notifications (e.g. win message, lose message, and what the candidate suit is). An interactive prototype can be found via a Figma file link [here](https://www.figma.com/file/DkZ46YNauuJN5EXRmbBwsD/506-hfp?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=gyZW5bYysmys202g-1) which is available to view without a Figma account and for free.

### Security Requirements

* Anyone accessing the backend should be authenticated before sending requests.

<!--Discuss what security requirements are necessary and why. Are there privacy or confidentiality issues? Is your system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks?-->

### System Requirements

<!--List here all of the external entities, other than users, on which your system will depend. For example, if your system inter-operates with sendmail, or if you will depend on Apache for the web server, or if you must target both Unix and Windows, list those requirements here. List also memory requirements, performance/speed requirements, data capacity requirements, if applicable.-->

As of now, the interface is designed specifically for a 16:9 monitor.

## Specification

<!--A detailed specification of the system. UML, or other diagrams, such as finite automata, or other appropriate specification formalisms, are encouraged over natural language.-->

<!--Include sections, for example, illustrating the database architecture (with, for example, an ERD).-->

<!--Included below are some sample diagrams, including some example tech stack diagrams.-->
